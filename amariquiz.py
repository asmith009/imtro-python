#1. What built-in function would you use if you wanted
# to print out data to a user?

# Answer: I would use the print function.

#2. What built-in function would you use if you wanted 
# a user to pass in data to a program?

# Answer: I would use the input function.

#3. Explain what complexity and abstraction are, then 
# provide an example describing their relationship to one another.
# You cannot use the following examples because they 
# were shared in class; grocery/ electronics store, car, phone. 

# Answer: complexity is the measure of reasources a program uses.
# Answer: Abstraction is the process of hiding complexity.
# Answer: An example would be like a computer mouse. In the unside is a bunch of wiring on the outside its only a couple buttons.

#4. What does it mean when you encounter a syntax error?

# Answer: A syntax error is something the computer cannot read

#5. What is a variable? Provide an example of a variable in code.

# Answer: A variable is a container for data.

#6. Write a function in Python that when called will print out 
# your name.

# Answer: a function i would use for this is string, and inout, Example: ('enter your name')

#7. What is a function definition and a function call?

# Answer: a function defenition is a a list of code the computer uses to read your functions.
# Answer: a function call, is typing a function in a block of code so when running your code the computer program will automatically call that function.

#8. Describe what each symbol means?

# = // single equal = assignment
# == // double equal = comparison
# != // exclaimation equal = arithmetic

#9. What will the output for the following code block be?
var1 = 1
var2 = 2
var3 = "3"

print(var1 + var2 + var3)

# Answer: syntax error, because the last one has a string attached to it, but not in the print.


#10. What will the output for the following code block be?
listOne = [20, 40, 60, 80]
listTwo = [20, 40, 60, 80]

print(listOne == listTwo)

# Answer: it would be true, because double equal means comparison , and they are both the same.

# 11. Create the following python lists and include the following
# data types for each list:
# a- create a python list of strings. The strings should be items you
# can find in a book bag.   ListBookbag['pencil', 'notebook', 'calculator']
# b- Create a python list of floats. the floats should represent the 
# price of each item in a book bag from the previous list.   ListFloat[1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5]

# 12. What are the Three (3) naming formats we use for naming variables, files, and functions?

# Answer: Letters, Underscores, descriptive.

# 13. Provide a coding scenario where you would you use a comparison operator in a program?

StudentId = 123550
AmariSmith = 123550
print(StudentId == AmariSmith)

# 14. Provide a coding scenario Where you would you use a logical operator in a program?

BankAccount = 4,000
IPhonePrice = 1,500
print(BankAccount > IPhonePrice)

# 15. Create a block of code where you would 
# use a comparison operator with the follwing data:
currentScore= 100
highScore=2300
print(currentScore == highScore)

# Bonus : What does the type() function do?

# Answer: I think it returns information.
