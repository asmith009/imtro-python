One time a peice of technology helped me in an unexpected way, was when a woman on drugs threw a brick at a families members head, and we had to call the ambulance for assistance as my family member was bleeding out, the peice of technology was a phone.
What it would be like if i lost technology that i use on a daily basis, is stressful but survivable.
Something i would need to do to replace that missing peice of technology is actually read a book or something like going outside. sadly.
