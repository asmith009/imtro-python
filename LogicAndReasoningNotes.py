# Logic and reasonning-

# Logic - Is the study of reasoning and inference.
# Reason - Is the faculty of the mind that enables us to think, understand, and form judgements logically

# Deductive Reasoning - This involves reasoning from general principles to specific conclusions.
# Example -              "All humans are mortal. Socrates is a human. Therefore, Socrates is mortal."
# Inductive Reasoning - This involves reasoning from specific observations to general conclusins.
# Example -              "Every swan i have seen is white. Therefore, all swans are white"(Though in reality, this could
#                         be disproven by finding a black swan)
# Abductive Reasoning - Also known as inference to the best explenation.

# The sientific method - A systematic approach used by scientists to investigate natural phenomena, aquire new knowlege, or
#                        refine existing understanding though empirical observation, experimentation, and logical reasoning.
#                        It invloves several key steps >>>.
# 1.  Observation/ question
# 2.  Research Topic Area
# 3.  Hypothisis
# 4.  Test With Experiment
# 5.  Analyze Data
# 6.  Report Conclusion

# Bias and Assumptions - A big part of develping your critcal thinking skills is learning how to come to unbiased conclusions.

# opertaors - actions that we can use on data.
'peanut butter ' and 'jelly'

# Arithmetic
# PEMDAS - basic match
value =  2+2

# comparison
# Greater than >
# less than <
# equal/ the same ==
# not equal/ not the same !=

# password =  input('please enter password.')
# if password == '123':
#   print('Correct')

# logical - 
    
# AND - The action that allows us to check if two statements are true.
# OR - The action that allows us to check if one of two statements are true.
# NOT - The action that allows us to flip the results of a statement.

# Assignment - assigning a value to a variable or a function.

# lists - A way to stroe multiple peices of data in one variable.

# if/ elif/ else - Conditional statements.
