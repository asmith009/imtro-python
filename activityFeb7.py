# 1A: To me a computer program is a instruction for a computer to follow specifically. To do one specific thing.

# 2A: Three types of data.
# 1   boolean
# 2   Integer
# 3   float

# 3A: Three python operators.
# 1   comparitive
# 2   assignment
# 3   arithmitic

# 4A: To me a variable is a place to store your code.

# 5A: An operator i would use for this is assignment.
#     I would use assignment to program the the computer to assign the gold tier member to be able to use the pool.

# 6A: In this situation i would use the operator arithmitic.
#     I would use arithmitic, and assignment. I would use arithmitic to take the 20% discount from the price.
#     I would use assignment to program the computer to assign the users specific items into their cart.

# 7A: I would use comparitive operator for this situation.
#     I would use comapritive for this situation because the number on the ID must match the number inside of the computer.
#     In order for this to happen the computer has to compare both of the numbers to allow the student to enter.
